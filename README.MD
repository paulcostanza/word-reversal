# Word reversal

A simple GUI Java app that reverses the words of your sentence. This project is my first attempt using *JOptionPanel* in Java.

I am incredibly proud that the app can detect punctuation at the end. It will leave it at the end when converted. The same goes for the capital letter at the beginning of the sentence.

### App demo
